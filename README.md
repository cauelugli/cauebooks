# This code repository is about my personal blog :) My very first project

Appart from technology, I love writting texts about different topics like phylosophy, family, humanity, society and etc.; talking about my own life experiences and perpection of things around the world and life, always with an informal approach. My writting style is to pretend I'm indeed talking to you, but for a while you just listen :)

It's a free access independent page with the intention of sharing my humble work with whoever might be interested, as well as a motivation to practice code.
I always liked the possibility of doing "whatever I'd like" into something; it gives you a good feeling that standard apps block you from having.

A simple application following the MVC pattern, with a minimalist styling.
